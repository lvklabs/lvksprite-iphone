MUST have some Xcode configuration:
Set up a shared build output directory that will be shared by all Xcode projects.
    With Xcode open, select “Xcode > Preferences” from the menubar.
    Select the “Building” tab.
    Set “Place Build Projects in” to “Customized location” and specify the path to the common build directory you created.
    Set “Place Intermediate Build Files in” to “With build products.”

Add a “Source Tree” variable that Xcode can use to dynamically find the static library project.

    Again, open the Xcode preferences.
    Select the “Source Trees” tab.
    Create a new Source Tree variable by clicking on the “+” button and filling in the columns.  
	--- We’re using “COCOS2d0992”!!! for the cocos2d-iphone variable name and that it points to 
	“/Users/PutYourUserHere/lvk/repos/cocos2d-iphone″.
	Tip: avoid using special characters in the actual file path (i.e., stick to alphanumeric characters,
	underscores, and hyphens); this path will be used as a “Search Path” and Xcode seems to have problems
	with search paths that use characters like an ampersand (&).
